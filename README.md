# LL Statement Assistant
I have devised a way for us accounts team to merge files without the use of paid software. I am also developing a code using Python to send mass emails to landlords for statements with files attached. 

The goals of this Assistant code are the following:
- Being able to send landlords the statement of accounts in an efficient and effective manner.
- Merging the tax invoices and statement of accounts without the use of paid software, as well as doing so efficiently (specifically meaning that we don't have to merge files per property one by one).
- Having a user friendly GUI for ease of use.

If there is anything to be requested and/or improved in the code. Please let me know. 

Thanks,
Ian Cris
